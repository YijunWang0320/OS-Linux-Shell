  The programming part contains makefile,shell.h,shell.c,testcase and this README.
  The non-programming part contains only one file called nonprog-homework1.
  The shell can pass all of the testcase in the python script, and the testcase that I tried.I used checkpatch to test my program, all of the errors and warnings are handled. 
Reliability:
	Reliable in all cases that I've tested,but there are commands that I did not test.
Code Simplicity:
	Not so good, handling the last programming problem requires recurrent techniques. However I did not implement the shell using recurrent techniques at first. So to make the code simple, I should have delele most of the code that I wrote and start from the beginning. However, to prevent the situation that I might fail to handle the last problem and finally blowing up the first three, I handle pipe commands in a new function. 
Assumptions:
	1. Whitespaces only include ' ' and '\t'.
	2. Most commands are seperated by whitespaces, except two commands seperated by pipe.
	3. Pipes should be used between commands, the situation where "ls | "is not used.
	4. We can accept inputs no longer than 1024 characters. If inputs are longer then this, an error will come up telling you the fact.
